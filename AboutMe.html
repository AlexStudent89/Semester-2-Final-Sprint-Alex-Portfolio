                <p>I am currently enrolled in Keyin College studying Software Development
                    and expected to graduate in August 2024. I hold a diploma in Graphic
                    Communications (2022) from the College of North Atlantic and a diploma
                    in Multimedia Graphic Design (2018) from Academy Canada. During my graphic
                    design and graphic communications studies, I realized that I enjoy computer
                    programming and problem solving. Also, understanding that the Technology
                    industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in Canada, I decided to
                    further my education in this area. In my Software Development studies,
                    I enjoy Web Design, Python programming, UI/UX software design, Cloud
                    Computing (AWS) as well as Data Security & Management. My graphic design
                    skills and creativity are being nicely integrated into my new skills in
                    software development. It's also rewarding to work in a team environment
                    on software development related projects.</p>
                <p>
                    I am an avid reader of fiction, graphic novels, and comics, and a big fan
                    of animation and video games. My hobbies also include writing, designing,
                    and illustrating graphic novels and webcomics. In all of the above, I
                    utilize computer graphic tools and programs, such as photoshop and adobe
                    illustrator, in addition to my newly developed skills in web design and
                    cloud computing.
